libicd-network-usb
==================

libicd-network-usb provides a network module for ICd2 that controls USB network
devices. The network module will look up the interface index for a network
interface named 'usb0'. The USB network interface is enabled by attaching an
USB cable and selecting 'PC Suite mode'. The module will detect the presence
of an USB network as long as the g_nokia kernel module is loaded. It will also
work if the device is in host mode, has a USB ethernet dongle attached and
proper kernel modules loaded for that ethernet dongle.

When a network scan is performed by icd2, the USB network module will list all
networks configured in GConf with of type 'USB', provided that the 'usb0'
network interface is found. When a USB network is selected from the 'Select
connection' dialog, the same check for 'usb0' will be performed and success
reported to icd2. Thus the next network module, in this case
libicd-network-ipv4 will be run, which then will attempt to configure an
IPv4 address using DHCP by default. It is up to the other end - PC or real
network - to provide the required DHCP server.

For the USB nework to work, it needs to be added to GConf with:
gconftool-2 -s -t string /system/osso/connectivity/IAP/<configname>/type USB
gconftool-2 -s -t string /system/osso/connectivity/IAP/<configname>/name 'Usb network'

Optionally it is possible to set the autoconnect flag with:
gconftool-2 -s -t boolean /system/osso/connectivity/IAP/<configname>/autoconnect true

libicd-network-ipv4 will work normally, i.e. use its IP configuration options
from the same /system/osso/connectivity/IAP/<configname>/ GConf path. The
connectivity UI seems to try to configure a WLAN network connection if the
settings are edited in the control panel in Fremantle. IP address selection
parameters are located behind the 'Advanced' button on the last page. After any
editing via the UI please check that the network type is properly (re)set to
'USB' by using the command above. Any other WLAN configuration items left in
GConf are ignored by the USB network module.
